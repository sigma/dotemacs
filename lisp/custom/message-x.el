;;; Commentary:

;; The most recent version of this can always be fetched from the
;; following FTP site:
;; ls6-ftp.cs.uni-dortmund.de:/pub/src/emacs

;; Installation:
;;
;; You must be using Gnus 5 or higher for this to work.  Installation
;; is simple: just put this file somewhere in your load-path, run M-x
;; byte-compile-file RET, and put the following line in your .gnus file:
;;
;;      (require 'message-x)
;;
;; Customization is possible through the two variables
;; message-x-body-function and message-x-completion-alist, which see.
;;
;; Purpose:
;;
;; This assigns a context-sensitive function to the TAB key in message
;; mode of Gnus.  When in a header line, this performs completion
;; based on which header we're in (for example, newsgroup name
;; completion makes sense in the Newsgroups header whereas mail alias
;; expansion makes sense in the To and Cc headers).  When in the
;; message body, this executes a different function, by default it is
;; indent-relative.
;;
;; To be more precise, the mechanism is as follows.  When point is in
;; a known header (a header mentioned in
;; `message-x-completion-alist'), then the completion function thus
;; specified is executed.  For the To and Cc headers, this could be
;; `bbdb-complete-name', for example.  Then we look if the completion
;; function has done anything.  If the completion function has NOT
;; done anything, then we invoke the function specified by
;; `message-x-unknown-header-function'.
;;
;; When point is in an unknown header (not mentioned in
;; `message-x-completion-alist'), then we invoke the function
;; specified by `message-x-unknown-header-function'.  This function
;; could advance point to the next header, for example.  (In fact,
;; that's the default behavior.)
;;
;; When point is not in a header (but in the body), then we invoke the
;; function specified by `message-x-body-function'.  By default, this
;; is `indent-relative' -- the default indentation function for text
;; mode.

Looks at the position of point to decide what to do.  If point is in
one of the headers specified by `message-x-completion-alist', then the
completion function specified there is executed.  If point is in
another header (not mentioned there), then the function specified by
`message-x-unknown-header-function' is executed.  If point is in the
body, the function specified by `message-x-body-function' is executed.

Completion is magic: after the completion function is executed, checks
are performed to see if the completion function has actually done
something.  If it has not done anything,
`message-x-unknown-header-function' is executed.  See the function
`message-x-call-completion-function' for details on how to check
whether the completion function has done something.

A non-nil optional arg SKIP-COMPLETION (prefix arg if invoked
interactively) means to not attempt completion.  Instead,
`message-x-unknown-header-function' function is called in all headers,
known or unknown."
